The folder contains the code to run the CNN network on the generated embeddings 
THe script CNN.py accepts a embeddings as text file 

script convert_to_txt.py converts the dictionary dump of the embeddings generated by previous step to text format 

How to run ?

1 . To generate the embeddings in text format : 
	
	Copy the dictionary dump in the CNN directory . Run the script 

	python3 convert_to_txt.py
	it will ask for the name of the dictionary dump as the input and generate the embeddings in the text format 

2 . Run the CNN 

	python3 CNN.py
	the script will ask for the embedding dimension and the embedding file name as input
	eg . 
	
	python3 CNN.py

	STDOUT:
	Enter the embedding dimensions : 12000
	Indexing word vectors.
	Enter the file name : wtv_txt
